# Bluetooth Low Energy with Android and Arduino: 

## Chapter 7: Read Data from a Peripheral


These are **complete downloadable code examples** from my book, _Bluetooth Low Energy with iOS Swift_.  The book teaches how to make Bluetooth Low Energy devices using iOS/Swift.  

This chapter teaches:
* Central: Read data from a Characteristic on a connected Peripheral
* Peripheral: Change the value of a hosted Characteristic
